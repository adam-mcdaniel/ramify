# ramify

Ramify is a prototype functional programming language with an interesting feature: _**every expression is a constant expression.**_ Everything that _can_ be computed at compile time _is_ computed at compile time, and replaced with a constant. This might simply sound like simple constant folding, but it is **much** more complex than it seems.
